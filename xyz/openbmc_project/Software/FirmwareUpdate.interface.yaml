    Simple definition of a Software or Firmware version. Note that this
    interface may be implemented by D-Bus objects that do not necessarily
    contain a software level. For example an OpenBMC log may implement this

    If looking for real software versions associated with a device then ensure
    this interface is under the /xyz/openbmc_project/software object path.
